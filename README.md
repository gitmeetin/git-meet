## Inspiration

- Having personal experiences struggling with finding great Open Source developers with similar interests, we decided to build our own platform to connect and help the OS community
- Finding good mentors with projects to collaborate on can be difficult but it doesn't have to be when you can meet up and also be friends with them!

## What it does

- GitMeet finds all the cool projects from other awesome devs near you.
- Put up your projects for others to find and we'll share it with the right people.
- Looking for mentors or a cool project from a local? We'll share the most interesting projects in your feed!
- Reach out to the developer with a list of all their public handles.
- Send a personalized message introducing yourself to them.
- Schedule a call to discuss your interests, collaborating, and making a friend!

## How we built it

- Datastax Astra
  - Deployed using Gcloud Datastax. Designed 4 relational tables using CQL and nodejs wrapper ORM for the same.
- Cloud NLP API
  - To get the text summary for the readmes and the important phrases out of the text, so you don't have to go through it all :D
- Serverless GCP
  - It was fun using a serverless stack for the project!
- Github OAuth
- ReactJS
- CSS

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

- Having a great time building it together ‚ù§
- Setting up and deploying APIs

## What we learned

We used Datastax Astra for the first time and had an amazing time with their well-written documents. 

*Built as a hackathon project for Shark Hacks, currently unmaintained*
